# Spawn plugin minecraft (Open Source)

This is a basic spawn plugin and for now you can simply set a spawn and go to it. More features will be added for when a player enters the server, be it message events or some custom ones!
It is open source for all people, especially for those who are starting to develop Minecraft plugins and in this way they can start with something simple, I am not the best expert and I am just starting but I hope it helps you!


# Requirements

These are based on what I used and it is the most recommended to avoid errors and they would be:

- Apache Maven 3.8.5
- Java 17


# Run it

You only need to use the apache maven command (maven or mvn) from the console, but being in the plugin folder.


# Credits

I was based on the [Bukkit-Boilerplate](https://github.com/2lstudios-mc/Bukkit-Boilerplate) repositor and thanks to it I was able to guide myself more easily in the Bukkit library, by the way, the [pom.xml](https://github.com/iZyro/Spawn-plugin-minecraft-Open-Source-/blob/main/pom.xml) belongs to them and was only modified.
